This project revolves around the use of AI techniques to localise a mobile robot in a known map using the sensor values.

To study about the concepts involved in this project, use Project_Presentation.pdf and Notes.pdf in Concepts folder.

Then open Project folder
1) The grid map is given in data.txt
2) Sample sensor values are stored in data.csv
3) To explore the grid and store different sensor values execute bot.py
	Use keys in keyboard to move the bot (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT).
4) Execute prediction.py to visualise the most probable sequence of locations the robot would have travelled.

This project can be further developed by implementing it in real time robot.
